## Deployment

**With Heroku:**

1. Sign in to your Heroku account or sign up for a new one.
   
2.	Connect your Heroku account to your GitHub account:
    * Navigate to the Heroku Dashboard.
    * Click on the "New" button and select "Create new app."
    * Give your app a unique name and choose the region closest to you.
    * Click "Create app."
    * In the "Deployment method" section, select "GitHub."
      
3. Search for the repository you want to deploy from your GitHub account.
   
4.	Once you've connected your GitHub repository, you can choose to either deploy the app automatically when changes are pushed to GitHub or manually deploy.
   
5. If you choose automatic deploys, select the branch you want to deploy from and enable automatic deploys.
   
6.	If you prefer manual deploys, you can trigger a deployment manually by clicking the "Deploy Branch" button.
   
7. Heroku will build your app using your project's build scripts and dependencies specified in your repository.
   
8. Once the build is complete, you can view your deployed application by clicking the "View" button on the Heroku Dashboard.
   
9.	You can manage your deployed application settings and view logs from the Heroku Dashboard.
Remember to set up any necessary configuration variables (such as environment variables) on the settings page.

**Fork and Clone Repository:**

1. Visit the GitHub repository and click on the "Fork" button in the top-right corner. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

2. On your forked repository's page, click on the "Code" button and copy the repository's URL.

3. Open your preferred Command Line Interface (e.g., Terminal, Git Bash) and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

4. Enter the following command in the command line:
   `git clone [repository URL]`

5. Navigate into the Repository: Use the cd command to navigate into the cloned repository:
   `cd [repository name]`

(Replace [repository URL] with the actual URL of your forked repository and [repository name] with the name of the cloned repository on your local machine.)
