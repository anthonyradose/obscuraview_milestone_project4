### Web Design -

#### Visual Aesthetic:

- The site has a refined and contemporary design, with a focus on minimalism and ease of navigation. The layout is crafted to provide a visually pleasing experience, allowing the photography to be the primary focus and enhancing the overall user experience.


#### Color Scheme:

- The site’s color scheme is almost solely black and white, with the a few minor bootstrap touches for the toasts, the basket, the banner, etc. Deliberately chosen this way to offer a slick, clean simple aesthetic so the background image and the prints can take center stage.


#### Typography:

- The site's typography is a blend of Playfair Display for the headings and website title, giving the site a timeless and classic feel. For body text and other elements, Roboto is used, ensuring a sleek, modern, and clean aesthetic that enhances readability and overall design cohesion.
